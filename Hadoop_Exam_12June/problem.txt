The managers of BigEnergy want to analyze the distribution of the energy efficiency
classes of buildings based on their city and year of construction. Design a MapReduce
application and write the corresponding Java code to address the following point:
 Most frequent energy efficiency class by city and year of construction.
For each (city, year of construction) pair, the application must identify the most
frequent energy efficiency class (i.e., the one that appears the highest number of
times) among the buildings in that group. In case of a tie in the count, the energy
class that comes first in alphabetical order must be chosen.
Each line in the output file must have the following format:
City,YearOfConstruction,MostFrequentEnergyClass
Note that the number of distinct values assumed by EnergyEfficiencyClass is seven, i.e., it
is a small value

Buildings.csv -> Gemini generated teh data in this repo!!
o This file contains descriptive information for each building. Each line in this file
corresponds to a single building.
o Format:
BuildingID,City,Country,SquareMeters,Type,Year,EnergyEfficiencyClass
o BuildingID: a unique identifier for the building (String).
o City: the city where the building is located (String).
o Country: the country where the building is located (String).
o SquareMeters: the total floor area of the building in square meters (Integer).
o Type: the type of building indicating its primary use, e.g., "Residential",
"Commercial", "Industrial" (String).
o Year: the year the building was constructed (Integer).
o EnergyEfficiencyClass: the energy efficiency rating of the building, i.e., "A", "B",
"C", “D”, “E”, “F”, “G” (String).
o Example:
 B_1001,Turin,Italy,120,Residential,1985,C
 B_1002,Lyon,France,200,Commercial,2010,A
 B_1003,Turin,Italy,50,Residential,1950,F
