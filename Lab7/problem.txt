1) register.csv contains the historical information about the number of used and free slots
for ~3000 stations from May 2008 to September 2008. Each line of register.csv
corresponds to one reading about the situation of one station at a specific timestamp.
Each line has the following format:
stationId\ttimestamp\tusedslots\tfreeslots
where timestamp has the format date time
For example, the line
23 2008-05-15 19:01:00 5 13
means that there were 5 used slots and 13 free slots at station 23 on May 15, 2008 at
19:01:00.
Pay attention that the first line of register.csv contains the header of the file. Moreover,
some of the lines of register.csv contain wrong data due to temporary problems of
the monitoring system. Specifically, some lines are characterized by used slots = 0 and
free slots = 0. Those lines must be filtered before performing the analysis. 

2) stations.csv contains the description of the stations. Each line of registers.csv has the
following format:
stationId\tlongitude\tlatitude\tname
For example, the line
1 2.180019 41.397978 Gran Via Corts Catalanes
contains the information about station 1. The coordinates of station 1 are
2.1800,41.397978 and its name is Gran Via Corts Catalanes.

Task 1
Write a single Spark application that identifies the most “critical” timeslot for each station.
This analysis can support the planning of the rebalancing operations among stations.
In this application, each combination “day of the week – hour” is a timeslot and is associated
with all the readings associated with that combination, independently of the date. For
instance, the timeslot “Wednesday - 15” corresponds to all the readings made on
Wednesday from 15:00:00 to 15:59:59, independently of the date.
A station Si is in the critical state in a specific timestamp if the number of free slots is equal
to 0 (i.e., the station is full).
The “criticality” of a station Si in the timeslot Tj is defined as
𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑛𝑢𝑚. 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑒 𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑡 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑜 0 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 (𝑆𝑖, 𝑇𝑗)
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 (𝑆𝑖, 𝑇𝑗)
Write an application that:
• Computes the criticality value for each pair (Si,Tj).
• Selects only the pairs having a criticality value greater than or equal to a minimum
criticality threshold. The minimum criticality threshold is an argument of the
application.
• Selects the most critical timeslot for each station (consider only timeslots with a
criticality greater than or equal to the minimum criticality threshold). If there are two or
more timeslots characterized by the highest criticality value for the same station,
select only one of those timeslots. Specifically, select the one associated with the
earliest hour. If also the hour is the same, consider the lexicographical order of the
name of the week day.
