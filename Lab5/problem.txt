Task 1
The first filter you should implement is the following:
• Keep only the lines containing words that start with the prefix “ho”
The returned RDD contains the set of lines (word\tfreq) that satisfy the filtering operation.
Print on the standard output the following statistics, based on the content of the RDD
returned by the filtering operation:
• The number of selected lines
• The maximum frequency (maxfreq) among the ones of the selected lines (i.e., the
maximum value of freq in the lines obtained by applying the filter).

Task 2
Extend the previous application. Specifically, in the second part of your application, among
the lines selected by the first filter, you have to apply another filter to select only the most
frequent words. Specifically, your application must select those lines that contain words with
a frequency (freq) greater than 80% of the maximum frequency (maxfreq) computed before.
Hence, implement the following filter:
• Keep only the lines with a frequency freq greater than 0.8*maxfreq.
Finally, perform the following operations on the selected lines (the ones selected by applying
both filters):
• Count the number of selected lines and print this number on the standard output
• Save the selected words (without frequency) in an output folder (one word per line)
